# Simple To-Do App

## Overview
This is a simple to-do application designed to help manage tasks efficiently. It allows users to save, delete, and mark tasks as completed. 

## Features
- **Save Tasks**: You can add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that you no longer need to track.
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark your tasks as completed once you've finished them.

## Technologies
The app is built using the following technologies:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, used for managing the state of the app.
- **LocalStorage**: Used to store the to-do items persistently in the browser's local storage.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of creating this application was to practice and improve my skills with React and Redux. It serves as a practical project to apply the concepts learned and to understand the workflow of using Redux in React applications.

Enjoy managing your tasks!
